			<h2>Collect your target sites</h2>

				<h3>Technique 1: Google search</h3>
					<p>Heading to Google for research seems quite obvious, but it’s
					the most straightforward way of finding relevant blogs and
					sites to contact. Just enter the type of blog or magazine (e.g.
					parenting news, or parenting blog) in the Google search box
					and click to check out the results that come up. Do these
					provide quality and relevant content? If so, start by copying the
					names of the websites into an Excel sheet. Organize them by
					type, and add a column for email addresses. The more
					organized you are, the easier it will be to keep track of your work.
					</p>

				<h3>Technique 2: Related search</h3>
					<p>So technique two provided you with some great websites to
					approach already, but you’re hungry for more. Cue: the related
					search operator. The whole idea here is to find other websites
					that would attract the same crowd of visitors or similar ones.
					This will allow you to search more accurately for websites that
					are similar in topic, content and quality. How does it work?
					Simply enter <strong>related: www.examplewebsite.com</strong> into the
					Google search box. This will generate a search engine results
					page <abbr title="search engine
					results page">(SERP)</abbr> full of websites that are very much like the one
					you found.</p>

				<h3>Technique 3: More advanced operators</h3>
					<P>To be even more precise, there are several other <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gwebsearcheducation/advanced-operators" target="blank">advanced
					operators</a> to search Google for relevant sites. These searches
					allow you to identify websites that have a specific search
					phrase in the URL, in the text, in the SEO title or as anchor
					text within the website. Here are a few of the advanced
					operators you can use to find more specific websites:</P>

						<dl>
							<dt>allinurl: search phrase</dt>
								<dd>the URL contains the search term, for
								example allinurl: best baby accessories.</dd>

							<dt><dt>Impanel</dt>
								<dd>the text on the page contains the search
								term.</dd>

							<dt>allintitle: search phrase</dt>
								<dd>the SEO title contains the search term.</dd>

							<dt>the SEO title contains the search term.</dt>
								<dd>an anchor text (text that links to a
								URL) on the page contains the search term.</dd>

			<h2>Write a compelling approach email</h2>

			<h2>Tailor to your audience</h2>
				<p>“Did you know that personalized emails have <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2016/01/70-email-marketing-stats-you-need-to-know/" target="blank">41% more click-through
				rates</a>? Well, now you do. And this is exactly why it’s crucial to tailor
				your message to the blogger you’re" approaching. Our advice is to do
				some research by looking at previous posts. Take a look to see what
				they’ve written and how you can tie in your offering to their past
				content. The ‘About section’ of a website is also a great place to find
				some valuable or personal info.”</p>

					<ol>
						<li>In English speaking countries, you can use a more friendly, casual
						tone. It’s acceptable to address the recipient by their first name
						and make polite jokes in the email.</li>

						<li>When targeting a webmaster in Germany, always use Frau and
						Herr and the person’s last name. Using their first name can be
						considered impolite.</li>

						<li>In France, it’s better to begin with a very formal approach and then
						relax your tone after two or three emails. Then, you can move to
						the more formal and professional “Cher” but couple it with the
						webmaster’s first name to show a certain level of friendliness.</li>

						<li>In Japan, people are expected to respond right away to any email
						they receive. Even if you don’t have time for a longer reply, write
						back to say that you will be in touch right away.</li>

						<li>When writing to webmasters in most Spanish speaking countries,
						you can use an informal tone and address them by their first
						names. However, the blogger community in Spain tends to be a bit
						more formal than their Latin American counterparts.</li>
					</ol>
